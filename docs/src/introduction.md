# Introduction

Welcome to the **RustFrame User Guide**. This book provides a tour of
RustFrame's capabilities from basic data handling to advanced machine learning
workflows. Each chapter contains runnable snippets so you can follow along.

To build this guide locally run `./build.sh` in the `docs/` directory. The
chapters are arranged sequentially:

1. [Data manipulation](./data-manipulation.md) for loading and transforming data.
2. [Compute features](./compute.md) for statistics and analytics.
3. [Machine learning](./machine-learning.md) for predictive models.
4. [Utilities](./utilities.md) for supporting helpers and upcoming modules.

Let's begin with some tabular data!
